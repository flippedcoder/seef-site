          <p>
            Dr. Christian Bell became the first SEEF Scholar to receive her
            Ph.D.
          </p>
          <p>
            Christian was one of the most financially challenged students to
            come through our program. Then, soon after graduating Spelman
            College in Atlanta, Georgia, her mother passed away.
          </p>
          <p>
            Despite these challenges, she earned a Bachelor of Arts in
            Psychology, a Master of Arts in Child and Adolescent Development,
            and now a Doctorate in Education Policy and Planning! Christian
            spent two years giving back to disadvantaged communities through
            Teach for America. We are so very proud of her!

            <p>Kenny Q.</p>
          </div>
          <p>
            Kenny Quang graduated from Union High School with an incredibly
            impressive 5.19 weighted GPA and continued on to the University of
            Oklahoma to study Microbiology.
          </p>
          <p>
            Kenny says, "I view education as an opportunity to wander the
            endless ocean of knowledge that is just waiting to be absorbed by
            young and motivated minds." Young and motivated he definitely is.
          </p>
          <p>
            An instructor at Union High School commented, "Kenny represents that
            student every teacher adores; he is intellectual, diligent,
            talented, and charming. He takes advantage of every opportunity to
            improve himself and demonstrate his assiduousness".

          <p>
            Harold "Wes" Phillips graduated from Memorial High School with an
            impressive GPA of 3.97. He double majored in Molecular Biophysics
            and Biochemistry at Yale University and later graduated from Weill
            Cornell Medical College.
          </p>
          <p>
            As a basketball player in high school, and a football player at
            Yale, he was a leader inside the classroom and out. The Simon Estes
            Educational Foundation, Inc. saw that quality in him when he
            graduated from Memorial, and is extraordinarily proud of him today.
            The Foundation says, "He exemplifies a leader. He leads by example.
            His enthusiasm for school and life in general is contagious."

          <p>Halee Scott studied Engineering at The University of Tulsa.</p>
          <p>
            As a member of the National Honor Society, Oklahoma Honor Society,
            Spirit Bank Roundtable, and an Oklahoma Scholar and Valedictorian,
            Halee was unstoppable.
          </p>
          <p>
            She said, "...raised with the mentality of a winner, I will not stop
            until I have obtained my goal." Others agree, "Truly, Halee is a
            unique and indomitable young lady. She has proven that she can
            accomplish anything with hard work and resolve."

          </div>
          <p>
            At Booker T. Washington High School, Steven Gary II was a star
            football player and excellent student. He especially enjoyed
            drafting classes and had a strong desire to attend college.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Simon Estes Educational Foundation, Inc. saw an opportunity to
            invest in Steven's future, and he has since graduated from the
            University of Tulsa with a degree in Engineering.
          </p>
          <p>
            His success has inspired others in his family. His mother says, "I
            am just so proud...so proud of him for accomplishing all that he
            has...If I had the strength to run a couple laps, I would."

            <p>Ramon W.</p>
          </div>
          <p>
            Ramon Watkins was a high school football star here in Tulsa. He
            dreamed of becoming a college football player and hoped that an
            athletic scholarship would put him through school.
          </p>
          <p>
            That's when The Simon Estes Educational Foundation, Inc. stepped in
            and helped Ramon attend college. He graduated top of his class at
            Cornell University, and became a Managing Attorney at ONEOK Partners
            in Tulsa.
          </p>
          <p>
            Ramon said one of the keys to his success was the support The Simon
            Estes Educational Foundation, Inc. gave him. "They didn't just give
            me a check....they checked in with me...they made sure I had
            emotional support - that makes a huge difference."
