        <div class="about-blurb">
          <p>
            The Simon Estes Educational Foundation, Inc. was founded in 1983.
            Led by Jayne L. Reed, a small group of Tulsans met with opera star
            Simon Estes, in town to perform with the Tulsa Opera. Bound by a
            mutual belief in the importance of education and concern for the
            many bright Tulsa-area high school seniors financially unable to
            attend college, the group decided to do what they could to assist
            these promising students. Mr. Estes and Ms. Reed serve as
            Co-Founders of the Foundation. Further showing his support, Mr.
            Estes has made numerous gratuitous concert appearances in Tulsa to
            benefit the Foundation.
          </p>

          <p>
            For over thirty years, the Foundation has raised several million
            dollars towards scholarships to assist hundreds of qualified,
            graduating Tulsa-area high school seniors. These Simon Estes
            Scholars have attended some of this nation's most prestigious
            colleges and universities with some participating in international
            study programs abroad.

          <h3>Jayne Reed</h3>
          <img src="./assets/jayne_reed.jpeg" />
          <p>
            It is my privilege to serve as Co-Founder of The Simon Estes
            Educational Foundation, Inc. and the extraordinarily talented Simon
            Estes Scholars who allow me to participate in the development of
            their futures through education.
          </p>
          <p>
            In 1982, I was inspired to establish this organization after
            consistently witnessing the myriad of college- age Tulsa youth
            working at jobs in the service sector for minimum wages. When
            questioned about their aspirations they would invariably muse about
            going to college “some day when I have enough money.” Further
            conversation revealed their histories of academic excellence, often
            interspersed by atypical family dynamics. Believing that education
            is the single most consistent and powerful means for advancement of
            an individual – I knew that I had to help young people like these.
          </p>
          <p>
            It is through the generosity of local business leaders and
            individuals, who commit their time, talent, and resources that The
            Simon Estes Educational Foundation, Inc. continues to fulfill its
            founding purpose of providing college scholarships to well-deserving
            Tulsa-area students.

          <h3>Simon Estes</h3>
          <img src="./assets/simon-estes.png" />
          <p>
            Known throughout the world for his opera, concert, and recital
            performances as well as his recordings, Simon Estes still finds time
            to share his love and knowledge of music with students from
            elementary school through college. In his master classes he teaches
            not only music, but artistic and personal values as well.
          </p>
          <p>
            Since 1985, Mr. Estes has taught at the Juilliard School of Music.
            His love and concern for youth is also manifested in the four
            scholarship organizations he has created. The Simon Estes
            Educational Foundation, Inc. in Tulsa is the most broad-based.
            Annually, a selection of students are offered major scholarships to
            enable them to attend the universities of their choice and pursue
            chosen majors.
          </p>
          <p>
            The success of this Foundation has spawned the formation of The
            Simon Estes International Foundation, Inc., Zurich, Switzerland in
            1984 and The Simon Estes Foundation, Cape Town, South Africa in
            1996. Restricted music scholarships are offered in Estes’ name at
            Centerville Community College, the University of Iowa, and through
            the Simon Estes Iowa Arts Scholarship Fund.
